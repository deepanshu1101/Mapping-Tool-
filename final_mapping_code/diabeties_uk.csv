Diabetes is a recognized risk factor for PD but there may also be a reverse relationship between these 2 diseases via common inflammatory mechanisms. Indeed severe forms of PD have been associated with worse metabolic control in subjects with T2DM. However little evidence is available on the potential benefit of PD therapy on metabolic control in T2DM. We hypothesise that effective PD treatment will improve metabolic control in T2DM. We plan to perform a single-blind 12 months randomized controlled clinical trial of 280 individuals suffering from T2DM and moderate to severe PD. After a baseline assessment including medical and oral measures, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an intensive (sub-gingival dental cleaning and minor gum surgery) or standard (repetitive supra-gingival dental cleaning) PD therapy groups and followed up to 12 months. HbA1c changes between study groups after 12 months is the primary outcome of the study. Changes in insulin concentration and sensitivity, inflammatory markers, lipids/diet and vascular function will also be assessed at 12 months between study groups as secondary outcomes.",University College London,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy1,NOT FOUND

However, there is also mounting evidence to support an important role for plasma membrane glycosphingolipids, in particular GM3, in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. GM3 has been suggested to associate with and negatively regulate insulin-receptor activity by promoting segregation of receptors to GM3-enriched membrane microdomains. GM3 can be synthesised from ceramide in response to saturated fatty acids (e.g. palmitate) and TNF?, which may also orchestrate changes in the expression of proteins regulating synthesis (GM3 synthase) and breakdown (NEU3) of GM3. Enhanced PKC/ERK/CREB signalling has been suggested to promote GM3 synthase expression in non-muscle cells, but we find that this pathway is also activated in muscle cells in response to palmitate and that this is antagonised by AMPK activators. The work described herein aims to: (i) define the signalling mechanisms regulating GM3 turnover in muscle cells in response to palmitate and TNF?, (ii) establish how GM3 promotes dysregulation of proteins involved in insulin signalling and (iii) assess whether pharmacological antagonism of glycosphingolipid metabolism enhances insulin sensitivity of cultured myotubes and skeletal muscle of obese rodents.",University of Dundee,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy3,NOT FOUND

Recent studies, however, have provided emerging evidence that the G-protein coupled receptor GPR55 may have a role in energy homeostasis. Building on this idea, we have made several novel observations which, for the first time, implicate this receptor in modulating key metabolic pathways within skeletal muscle - a major site of glucose utilisation and storage. Firstly, we have discovered that ligand-induced activation of GPR55 significantly improves insulin sensitivity in cultured skeletal muscle cells. In addition, treatment with GPR55 agonists increases the activity and/or expression of proteins (AMPK, CREB and PGC-1?) involved in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Furthermore, we have uncovered potential GPR55-mediated regulation of the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids are arachidonic acid-derived lipids which have been implicated in energy balance and metabolism. Interestingly, we observe altered expression of genes which function in the synthesis and/or degradation of endocannabinoids in response to known GPR55 agonists. Importantly, based on these observations, we anticipate that GPR55 activation would result in suppressed endocannabinoid tone thereby potentially improving metabolic status. Therefore, our aim is to understand, both mechanistically and functionally, how direct modulation of GPR55 impacts upon skeletal muscle metabolic capacity.",University of Dundee,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy4,NOT FOUND

This inflammatory response involves activation of the canonical proinflammatory NF-?B pathway, which can be triggered by an increase in circulating saturated free fatty acids (e.g. palmitate) as occurs during obesity or in response to high dietary fat intake. Whilst it is well established that NF-?B induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6 and TNF?? implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, what has remained unclear is how the NF-?B pathway is activated by palmitate. Interestingly, the palmitate-induced proinflammatory response is antagonised by unsaturated fatty acids and by pharmacological inhibition or activation of ERK and AMPK, respectively. These observations imply that ERK is a component of the fatty acid-induced inflammatory response, whereas AMPK and unsaturated fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects that could be exploited to preserve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. The work described herein aims to (i) define how palmitate promotes NF?B signalling via ERK in skeletal muscle cells and the impact this has on processes influencing insulin action and metabolic capacity and (ii) determine, at the molecular level, the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which AMPK opposes palmitate-induced NF?B signalling.",University of Dundee,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy5,NOT FOUND

Previously, we have investigated how metal ions modify the activity of drugs. Copper interaction with biguanides such as metformin has been known for over a century and in our preliminary studies we have gathered strong evidence that copper is required for specific cellular actions of metformin linked to its beneficial clinical effects. In the current study we will elucidate the precise role of copper in metformin action using unique chemical tools and a variety of techniques including western blotting, gene expression analysis, microscopy and animal studies. This research will establish which effects of metformin are copper-dependent, and of these which are sensitive to specific modes of interaction with the metal.

The increase in AMP activates AMPK by promoting net phosphorylation on Thr172 of the AMPK ??subunit mediated via the kinases LKB1 and CaMKK?. Activation of AMPK, which switches on energy consuming and turns off energy promoting pathways, is believed to underlie the main beneficial effects of metformin. A protein phosphatase, Ppm1E, which dephosphorylates AMPK?-Thr172 in cell cultures, has recently been identified in my laboratory. Since inhibition of AMPK?-Thr172 dephosphorylation would lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, an inhibitor of Ppm1E is likely to be beneficial for the treatment of diabetes. The project aims to examine whether Ppm1E dephosphorylates AMPK?-Thr172 in an in vivo mouse model. Part of the single mouse gene encoding Ppm1E will be replaced in mouse embryonic stems cells, so that an inactive Ppm1E is synthesized. Mice derived from these stem cells will be examined phenotypically and biochemically for the expression of inactive Ppm1E, the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in several tissues and other parameters that are relevant to diabetes.

A major risk factor for IHA is repeated exposure to hypoglycaemia. There are many parallels between how the body responds to repeated hypoglycaemia and a stress response called pre-conditioning. Pre-conditioning is induced when a non-damaging stressful stimulus is presented to cells to promote a transient adaptive response so that injury resulting from subsequent exposure to the harmful stimulus is reduced. Hypoglycaemia has all the characteristic features of a preconditioning response in that the depth, duration, and frequency of antecedent hypoglycaemia correlated with the magnitude of the ensuing counterregulatory deficit, and the defect resolves with hypoglycaemia avoidance. Preliminary data suggest that the cytokine, interleukin-6 (Il-6), may be central to hypoglycaemic pre-conditioning. Pre-exposure of hypothalamic glucosensing neurons to Il-6 increased their threshold for electrical silencing, while pre-exposure of hypothalamic slice preparations to Il-6 significantly reduces their sensitivity to low glucose.

In this project we will use our existing experimental model to determine how MSCs improve islet transplantation outcomes by measuring the effects of MSCs on islet survival and function in vitro and in vivo. We will determine which population(s) of MSCs, or other stromal cells, are most effective at supporting islet function, and we will adapt our experimental model to more closely mimic the clinical situation by intraportal delivery of the islet grafts.

Together with a parallel investigation of potentially important childhood determinants of emerging ethnic differences in type 2 risk, the results will inform strategies for early prevention of type 2 diabetes in the next generation, particularly in UK South Asians and black African-Caribbeans.

I will examine this hypothesis using two modalities of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), blood oxygen level dependent and continuous arterial spin labelling fMRI. With these non-ionising imaging techniques I will evaluate the brain's response to both food imaging, a surrogate of food consumption, and to food eating, while measuring satiety. I will compare non-obese insulin resistant individuals at high risk for obesity and diabetes with insulin-sensitive peer controls from our local multicultural population, before and after an insulin-sensitising intervention of lifestyle changes and metformin, to examine the central predictors of obesity and diabetes, their correlation with inflammatory markers of insulin resistance, and the potential for modulating them by manipulating insulin sensitivity.",King's College London,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy43,NOT FOUND

The impairment of beta cell function appears to be the critical event in progressive deterioration of glycaemic control. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating beta cell function is therefore crucial to identify potential sites of dysfunction. Our preliminary data demonstrate that downregulation of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2alpha (PI3K-C2alpha) specifically occurs in beta cell from Type 2 diabetic individuals. Mimicking these conditions in rat insulinoma cells strongly reduces insulin secretion suggesting that the detected downregulation in Type 2 diabetic individuals is at least in part responsible for impairment of beta cell function. This project will definitely determine whether downregulation of PI3K-C2alpha is a feature of Type 2 diabetes and the mechanisms responsible for such downregulation and it will define the signalling pathways regulating PI3K-C2alpha activation and action in beta cell.

T cell responses are normally subject to stringent regulation by the regulatory T cell (Treg) population, and this depends at least in part on the function of the CTLA-4 protein. Some data suggest that Treg function is defective in T1D and variation at the ctla-4 locus is associated with disease. Whilst CTLA-4 is undoubtedly a major regulator of immune responses, in disease settings it may not be CTLA-4 itself that is faulty but the pathways that impact upon its function. In this respect we have identified a novel molecular mechanism of CTLA-4 function which is critically dependent on the ability of CTLA-4 to traffic correctly through the cell. We therefore wish to test the hypothesis that CTLA-4 function is compromised in individuals with T1D and that this limits their capacity to provide appropriate immune regulation.

This research proposes to explore the reasons people choose not to engage and to develop ideas on how best to ?reach out' to diverse populations. The study has three phases: 1. A quantitative survey using structured questionnaires that can be completed via an interview or online. 2. Case studies to investigate why some organisations have very high engagement rates whilst others have relatively low engagement of users. 3. Qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore the results of the previous two phases in greater depth with people who did not engage with SDE, plus parents of adolescents and to seek their views on future developments.

Although fermentable carbohydrate is not absorbed in the small intestine it is full fermented by the colonic bacteria. The fermentation of this carbohydrate produces short chain fatty acids which act on specific G protein coupled receptors (GPR41/43) in the intestine to release GLP-1 and PYY. GLP-1 and PYY are hormones which act on appetite centres in the brain to decrease appetite. GLP-1 incretin effects and possible effect of the beta cell will increase insulin sensitivity. Short chain fatty acids also suppress the release of free fatty acids from adipocytes. Lower levels of free fatty acids in insulin resistant subject's leads to improved insulin sensitivity.

While the detrimental effects of long term high fat / high glucose diets are clear, the associated mechanisms of diabetogenic dysfunction remain poorly defined. It is however known that diabetes develops when ?-cell function is unable to meet insulin demand, due to compromised insulin secretory capacity or functional failure and destruction of ?-cell mass. Glucolipotoxicity-induced islet inflammation and programmed cell death are thought to underlie the developing dysfunction, with these processes being amplified through the cytokine IL-1??? Importantly, ourselves and others have generated preliminary data which indicates that strategies encompassing a reduction in IL-1?-induced acetylation might offer a protective mechanism to prevent islet cell death in T2D. Crucially however, the molecular targets for acetylation currently remain unknown.

In vivo, the situation is likely to be complex, however, because ?-cells respond differentially to individual FFAs. Under these conditions, the net response will be determined by the relative contributions of long chain saturated molecules (which are frequently lipotoxic) and various long chain mono- and poly-unsaturated FFAs (which are less toxic and can provide cytoprotection). Importantly, the molecular basis of these differential responses to saturated and unsaturated FFAs is unknown but we hypothesize that they are handled differentially within the cells and that one can influence the uptake and intracellular disposition of the other. Surprisingly, the mechanisms controlling FFA uptake and distribution in ?-cells remain largely undefined, principally because these processes are difficult to study in real time. In the present work, we will use a multidisciplinary approach to explore these parameters in single ? cells, using the UK's only microscope combining three non-linear imaging modalities (multiphoton fluorescence, stimulated Raman and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering) in a single instrument.

However, nearly nothing is known of the physiological role of Cxs in the tubular system.

Loss in cell-cell adhesion is associated with a loss in function. To understand how changes in cadherin expression, localization and function directly affect cell coupling, membrane rigidity and deformation we require an interdisciplinary approach to study membrane dynamics. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) will be used to determine the minute forces (Pico-Newton) necessary to uncouple adherent cells under different glycaemic conditions. This functional measure of cell-adhesion can resolve subtle changes in cell-cell interactions that precede changes in function and can therefore identify underlying mechanisms linking proteomics to overt tissue complications of diabetes. Cell-coupling depends on membrane elasticity. In tubular epithelial cells glucose-evoked cell volume regulation involves architectural remodeling of the cytoskeleton to resist morphological change.

There is increasing evidence that T2D and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share common risk factors, including obesity, with AD also characterised by impaired glucose metabolism. Excess activity of the protease ?-secretase (BACE1) is an important driver for AD pathology. We have shown that BACE1-null mice, on normal diet, are lean, highly insulin sensitive with improved glucose disposal. When placed on a chronic high fat diet they resist diet-induced obesity (DIO) and retain better insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis than wild type controls on the same diet. Now we wish to define which tissues are responsible for the improved insulin sensitivity and determine whether administration (subcutaneously and orally) of drugs that inhibit BACE1 can reverse or prevent T2D associated with obesity.",Ninewells Hospital And Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy102,NOT FOUND

The focus of this programme of work is to better understand the central mechanisms that underpin glucose-sensing during acute hypoglycaemia and the development of hypoglycaemic unawareness; adverse effects of insulin therapy that are of great concern to people with diabetes. In order to pursue this aim we utilize electrophysiological recordings from central (e.g. hypothalamic) neurons to determine the electrical response of these neurons to hypoglycaemic challenge. A recent and exciting development in our laboratory has been the validation of a mouse hypothalamic cell line as a useful model to examine the molecular mechanisms of neuronal glucose sensing, with a view to better define neuronal responses to acute hypoglycaemia and to develop this model to investigate, in a way that has not been possible up to now, the molecular characteristics that characterize hypoglycaemic unawareness.",Ninewells Hospital And Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy103,NOT FOUND

Thus, targeting iNKT cells may also offer new ways of treating human T1DM. However, a deeper understanding of the changes in iNKT repertoire and function, both during early stages and progression of human T1DM is required. We have recently shown that functionally different human iNKT subsets can be identified using new molecular tools developed in our laboratory. Our preliminary findings in 10 people with T1DM and age-/gender-matched controls indicate significant changes in these iNKT subsets and their functions in early T1DM. To corroborate and extend these findings, we propose to carry out cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to characterise the composition and function of the iNKT repertoire in early T1DM compared to age- and gender-matched healthy matched controls.

The recent advent of genome-wide sequencing has invigorated the field by allowing identification of gene polymorphisms linked with T2D. At the single-cell level, gene-silencing/transduction approaches have provided evidence for a role of T2D-associated genes in normal insulin secretion. At the whole-animal level, beta-cell specific deletion of the same genes leads to glucose intolerance. However, extrapolating findings between these two levels is complicated by the dependence of beta-cells on their native tissue context for proper function. Moreover, insulin secretion is not simply a reflection of unitary beta-cell activity, but requires the concerted function of thousands of cells residing within an islet. Therefore, to link defective insulin exocytosis with impaired insulin fluctuations in the blood, studies are required to assess how T2D-associated genes alter beta-cell function at the single-cell and population levels in the intact tissue.

The density of the previously-cloned GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) is very low in ?-cells suggesting that the effects of GLP-1 on glucagon secretion are mediated by paracrine effects. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that physiologically-relevant GLP-1 levels (1-10 pM) suppress glucagon release by a direct (non-paracrine) action. In addition, the supposedly-inactive metabolite GLP-1 (9-36) remains capable of suppressing glucagon secretion in islets from mice lacking GLP-1Rs.

Diabetic pain is poorly treated as the available drugs either have limited efficacy or intolerable side effects for the majority of patients. The detailed mechanisms responsible for the neuropathy and the painful symptoms in diabetes are unknown. This project proposal is based on our original observations that methylglyoxal, a molecule formed specifically during hyperglycaemia, evokes pain and loss of intra-epidermal nerve fibres by stimulating TRPA1. The proposed work will determine the importance of TRPA1 in the genesis and maintenance of painful and insensate diabetic sensory neuropathy. Identification of TRPA1 as an important mediator of sensory changes in diabetes and as an effector molecule of diabetic neuropathy will provide new rationales for the development of novel treatments for diabetic neuropathy.

Accumulating evidence implicates ATP-regulated K+-channels (KATP-channels) in the metabolic regulation of glucagon secretion. Whereas an increase in glucose from 1 to 6 mM inhibits glucagon secretion in human islets from non-diabetic donors (ND), it stimulates glucagon release in patients with type-2 diabetes. This defect can be reproduced by exposing islets from non-diabetic islets to the KATP-channel activator diazoxide at concentrations not affecting insulin secretion. Glucagon secretion in such ?T2DM islets? at low glucose was also much lower than in control islets. Thus, both abnormalities of glucagon secretion in diabetes can be induced by pharmacological activation of the KATP-channels. We propose to study the pathophysiological significance of this finding and its causes by a combination of biochemical measurements of glucagon secretion, electrophysiology, Ca2+-imaging and genetics. We will correlate glucagon secretion from human islets to genotype and phenotype of the donors focusing on ?diabetogenic' parameters (risk alleles, BMI, age), attempt to mimic these experimentally (in ND human and rodent islets) and explore if they can be corrected by the clinically used sulphonylureas (that block the KATP-channels).",University of Oxford,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy133,NOT FOUND

Despite the fact that islet cell progenitors contribute to increases in islet cell mass in the post-natal period, we have little information on the identity of these cells or why they fail in people with diabetes. Recently we developed a novel panel of human pancreatic stem cell lines - PEndo cells, which can be differentiated to insulin-producing cells using a defined protocol. Here, we will use proteomic profiling of PEndo cells to document the expression profiles of cell surface protein markers associated with stage-specific differentiation of the cells. Through these studies we expect to identify specific proteins associated with distinct stages of differentiation which we will then validate in the developing human pancreas and a model of human pancreas regeneration. This work will provide a greater understanding of the roles of these cells in both the progression of diabetes and therapeutic responses to conventional drugs. Further, by defining specific markers, antibody-based cell sorting techniques could be used to isolate and purify progenitor cells from the human pancreas for drug-discovery purposes and for cell-based treatments of diabetes. (194 words)What is the aim of the research? During the progression of diabetes insulin-secreting cells fail and the body is unable to fully replace these cells. The reasons for this are unknown and the identity of pancreatic stem cells remains elusive. Here, we will use recent advances in stem cell biology to first search for markers of pancreatic stem cells, and second to validate our findings through studies involving the development biology of the pancreas and human pancreas regeneration. What do we already know as a result of research carried out in this area, and how does the proposed research build on this? We know very little about the process that controls islet cell mass in humans and even less about the identity of human pancreatic stem cells. By contrast, we have a great deal of information about the control of islet cell numbers in rodent models and rodent models of diabetes. Since there is good evidence that rodents and humans are fundamentally different in the ways in which they respond to ageing and disease mechanisms, it is imperative that the human studies are advanced in this area. Ours is a novel project involving innovative techniques and will add greatly to research on this important area. Please outline the experimental/research methods to be used. We have developed a unique panel of human pancreatic stem cell lines. These cell lines can be maintained in the laboratory for long periods of time and we can control the laboratory conditions in order to ensure that these cells will make insulin. In this project we aim identify specific characteristics or ?signatures? on the surface of cells at each of the stages of their conversion to insulin producing cells. This is important as it will allow us to better understand the role of these cells in the pancreas, how we can encourage them to make more insulin producing cells, and how we can identify and isolate these cells from donor pancreas during islet transplantation procedures.. The way in which we will characterise these cells is through ?proteomic profiling?. This is a new and innovative technique which will allow us to take a snapshot of the proteins located on the surface of cells and thereby allow us to recognise differences between these cells and the many other cell types that are found in the pancreas. How will the research impact on people living with diabetes and what is the timeframe for this? This basic research will work towards improved knowledge of the cause of diabetes and improved future treatment options via testing new drugs for type 2 diabetes. This is a short-term objective which will see important advances during the tenure of support and applied research within 5 years of the end of the project. A longer-term goal is that this work will also lead to the isolation of stem cells from the pancreas so that these cells could be used in islet transplantation initiatives as a possible cure for diabetes. Since this will require significant longer-term investment it may only have an impact upon people with diabetes within 10 years. Does the research involve animals?

The characteristic podocyte response to injury or stress is actin cytoskeleton reorganisation, leading to foot process effacement, proteinuria and irreversible podocyte depletion due to their inability to proliferate and regenerate. The Cell division autoantigen 1 (CDA1) pathway is shown to modulate TGF-? signalling. Podocytes contain both CDA1 and its receptor CDA1BP1, with TGF-? identified as a key mediator of podocyte injury. An in vitro podocyte injury model will be employed, utilising both immortalised human podocytes cultured at physiological (5mM) or high glucose concentrations (20mM), alongside primary podocytes isolated from wild-type (WT) and CDA1 knockout (KO) mice, with or without diabetes. TGF-? will be employed as the injurious stimuli and has been reported to produce podocyte apoptosis, de-differentiation and an EMT-like response resulting in increased collagen deposition. These responses to TGF-? will be used as end-points in the presence and absence of CDA1 knockdown to determine if CDA1 is involved in causing podocyte injury in response to TGF-?. In addition the pro-fibrotic effect of CDA1 will be targeted pharmacologically by disrupting the interaction of CDA1 and CDA1BP1.",University of Bristol,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy141,NOT FOUND

The accumulation of lipid within muscle cells (IMCL), and the associated lipid metabolites, is a major cause of insulin resistance and is due to an imbalance between muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation. Dietary controlled weight loss can reduce IMCL accumulation in insulin resistant individuals and improve glycaemia, but it is difficult to achieve in the general population. Furthermore, weight loss via caloric restriction does not always restore the ability to increase fat oxidation and thus reduce IMCL. Therefore, nutritional strategies to increase muscle fat oxidation and reduce IMCL in individuals with T2D are warranted. Carnitine translocates fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. We have demonstrated that increasing muscle total carnitine (TC) content by >15% in young men improved muscle glucose disposal at rest, and increased fat oxidation during low intensity exercise. Reduced muscle TC and insulin resistance are reversed with L-carnitine feeding in obese rats. We aim to determine for the first time whether increasing muscle TC during 6 months of L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate IMCL and insulin resistance, and improve glycaemia in individuals with T2D compared to control.",University of Nottingham,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy142,NOT FOUND

Tissue remodelling requires the re-establishment of a vascular network from the existing circulation (angiogenesis) and is initiated by release of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). FGF-2 stimulates all stages of angiogenesis and is unusual in that it lacks a signal peptide, is stored intracellularly and is more susceptible than other growth factors to glycation. FGF-2 also binds to extracellular components providing a stable reservoir. Glycated-FGF-2 (g-FGF-2) is present in diabetics and impairs wound healing but few studies have addressed its importance in human subjects. We will quantify the amounts of FGF-2 and g-FGF-2 in human tissue (punch biopsies) and serum from 51 diabetic and 20 normal subjects and wound tissue from diabetic subjects only, using a competitive ELISA assay.

Selective CB1R blockade, using antagonists such as rimonabant, have been shown to exert beneficial effects upon whole body energy balance that exceed the anorexigenic response initiated by central mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that endocannabinoids (ECs) acting via CB1R may directly modulate fuel/energy homeostasis in tissues such as skeletal muscle, which makes a major contribution to whole body glucose disposal and insulin action. Consistent with this, we have discovered that sustained activation of CB1R desensitises proximal insulin signalling events in cultured muscle cells, whereas receptor antagonism is insulin-sensitising. In this proposal we will investigate further how expression of CB1R is regulated in skeletal muscle and how its autocrine modulation by natural ECs, as well as pharmacological agonists/antagonists, impacts mechanistically on fuel use, energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In addition, we will evaluate these key metabolic processes under normal circumstances and in response to stimuli that may alter EC tone (e.g. ageing and exercise).",University of Dundee,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy147,NOT FOUND

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have two properties that suggest they may be a useful starting material for generating ?-cells for transplantation. First, they can be grown outside the body to produce the large numbers of cells required. Secondly they are pluripotent, which means that they have the potential to turn into any cell in the adult body, including insulin-secreting ?-cells. For this reason many laboratories around the world, including ours, are investigating ways of turning ES cells in to ?-cells but there may be problems associated with these cells. First, recent work from our laboratory suggests that insulin-expressing cells derived from stem cells are not authentic ?-cells. We need to know the identity of these cells if we plan to produce them in large numbers for use in transplantation therapy. This project will investigate insulin-expressing cells derived from human ES (hES) cells to determine their developmental origin and to determine whether they function like authentic ?-cells. Secondly, it is likely that the quality of the starting hES cells will influence the quality of the ?-cells. We propose that hES cells generated from stressed blastocysts, or themselves stressed during their growth and development, may develop errors in important parts of the cells known as mitochondria - these errors will affect the way the ?-cells recognise and respond to changes in blood sugar and may result in the failure of the ?-cells.

One of the molecular links between Western feeding habits, obesity and insulin resistance is cellular inflammation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that becomes stressed by dietary and genetic obesity, resulting in ?ER stress response? in liver and adipose tissue, leading to inflammation and insulin resistance. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major regulator of glucose homeostasis and body mass via inhibition of insulin and leptin signalling. PTP1B is localised to the ER and was recently implicated in having a role in ER stress response pathway. However, its role in this pathway in the setting of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance is unclear. I hypothesise that PTP1B plays a role in obesity-induced ER stress response in liver and adipose tissue. I aim to test whether liver-specific PTP1B deletion in mice will protect against obesity-induced glucose intolerance, ER stress response and impaired insulin signalling.

We are producing insulin and modified insulins in yeast to identify more clearly the critical regions necessary for autoantibody binding. Using this experience, we will add peptide tags to insulin that allow the molecule to be captured by specific labelled antibodies. The ability to capture the tagged insulin will give new flexibility to assay design, which is not possible with native insulin. Once the tagged insulins have been expressed, processed and purified, we will raise antibodies to the peptide tag and use these to capture the tagged insulin.

We hypothesise that this could be important in determining increased diabetes risk because inflammatory responses in the islet are ?programmed? by early life events and exacerbated by programming of an exaggerated proinflammatory response in adipose tissue. We will therefore determine whether: 1) chronic inflammation of the islet is a factor that precipitates ?-cell failure (function and mass) in insulin resistance when the islet is challenged to secrete more insulin. 2) early life events that programme obesity also activate inflammatory signalling pathways within the islet, thereby predisposing it to adverse effects of exposure to nutrient stressors (elevated glucose and lipid) and exacerbated impairment of islet adaptations to insulin resistance.

Loss of insulin regulation of gluconeogenesis contributes to the hyperglycemia that defines T2DM. We have shown that activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PDK1 and PKB are required for insulin repression of gluconeogenic genes, and that inhibition of GSK3 (downstream of PKB) is sufficient to mimic insulin action and turn off these genes. GSK3 inhibitors reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic animals at least in part through this mechanism. However such compounds have unwanted side effects making them unlikely therapeutics. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that PKB could negatively regulate the FOXO transcription factors. FOXO isoforms also regulate the gluconeogenic genes and a FOXO-binding element is regulated by GSK3. Therefore we hypothesise that GSK3 signalling converges with FOXO signalling to mediate proper regulation of these genes. To characterise this in detail we will establish whether GSK3 regulates FOXO directly, whether the convergent signalling occurs through a FOXO-interacting protein and whether all FOXO target genes are regulated by GSK3. The work aims to find a mechanism to generate the insulin mimetic effect of GSK3 inhibitors without the unwanted side-effects.",Ninewells Hospital And Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy192,NOT FOUND

This study was undertaken in a tertiary diabetes only hospital in Denmark. To our knowledge no attempt has been made to reproduce this study in routine out-patient clinical practice in the UK using a mainly nurse led protocol. Moreover the Steno 2 Study did not look at anaemia or hyperparathyroidism as modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. There is much evidence for the positive benefit of nurse led interventions on one or two risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.

Evidence suggests that C-peptide, previously believed to be inert, has significant bioactivity and offers the potential for development as a new therapeutic agent to prevent diabetic complications. Data show that C-peptide has multiple signalling effects and protects kidney cells from changes associated with diabetic nephropathy. Although specific binding of C-peptide to cells has been demonstrated, the identity of the receptor remains to be determined. Furthermore, how the actions of C-peptide are related to the development of complications in type 2 diabetes remains uncertain. The aims of this study are to: 1) identify and clone the C-peptide receptor using a variety of biased and un-biased strategies; 2) determine whether C-peptide resistance is present in Type 2 diabetes using circulating blood erythrocytes and monocytes; 3) examine how C-peptide may impact on the signalling of advanced glycosylation end products in kidney cells and whether C-peptide might offer protection from the detrimental effects of these agents and their receptor signalling properties.

Insulin stimulates glycogen synthase (GS) via inactivation of GSK3 and allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Disruption of GSK3-mediated activation of GS by insulin results in normal muscle glycogen levels and glucose tolerance. This suggests that G6P-mediated activation of GS may play a key role in stimulating muscle GS in vivo, and contributes to the maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, GS knock-in mice with mutated G6P binding sites will be generated. Analysis of these mice will provide mechanistic insights into how insulin promotes glycogen synthesis in vivo. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a regulator of energy balance at both the cellular and whole body levels. Most of the metabolic changes induced by AMPK activation, such as increased muscle glucose uptake, decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased fat oxidation, would be desirable outcomes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

There is also increased risk of dementia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are more prone to T2D. Both AD and T2D have peripheral hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in common. A key enzyme associated with AD progression is BACE1, with increased levels and activity linked to high levels of Abeta, plaques and risk of AD. BACE1 is up-regulated by cellular metabolic stresses such as hypoxia, ischemia and hypercholesterolemia. Our preliminary work demonstrates the link between metabolic stress and BACE1 to be bi-directional. Mice with no, or reduced BACE1, are lean, resistant to diet-induced obesity and have improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Our data on intact muscle and muscle cell lines indicates that reduced BACE1 is associated with increased insulin signalling and higher levels of AMPK activity. We aim to consolidate these initial results and extend our analysis to encompass the effects of BACE1 levels/activity on insulin- and AMPK-dependent pathways converging on GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. Additionally, we intend to examine whether reduced BACE1 in a muscle cell line protects against, or reverses, the induction of insulin resistance.",Ninewells Hospital And Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy221,NOT FOUND

Further studies using a naturally occurring mutant of TBC1D1 (the R125W polymorphism associated with a rare severe familial obesity in females) demonstrate that this mutation enhances the binding of TBC1D1 to MICAL1 and Rab10, and reduces binding to the known interactors AMP kinase and 14-3-3 proteins.

Mechanisms that control BK channel activity and/or surface expression thus represent fundamental regulators of beta-cell function. We have recently identified that S-acylation (palmitoylation), a reversible post-translational lipid modification of proteins, controls BK channel trafficking and activity and that pancreatic BK channels are endogenously palmitoylated.

We have recently used mass-spectrometry to detect at least three residues in HIPK3 modified by acetylation. Importantly, these residues lie within critical domains of the protein. These include the active site of the kinase itself, but also a conserved nuclear localisation signal (NLS).

Furthermore we want to determine the conditions that lead to these acetylation event(s) in beta cells, and to analyse the presence of this modification in vivo, using mouse and human tissue.

Frequent and different-scale purifications of constructs of the Insulin Receptor (IR), their complexes with insulin and its analogues are the core of the YSBL group's research. Cloning and production of the IR is technically challenging, and the main obstacle in insulin/IR research. Typically, yields are very low, resulting in extremely high costs (>Â£1K/mg) of the final protein product. To maximize efficiency in purification of the IRs requires the strictest methodological regime, hence access to dedicated, state-of-the-art and highly reliable protein purification FACILITIES. The age of YSBL's existing FACILITIES and pressure on its availability are the reasons why the insulin research group needs to obtain its own system.",University of York,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy240,NOT FOUND

Reagents that deplete only those B-cells reactive with islet autoantigens should be most effective in Type 1 diabetes prevention and treatment.

Fc chimeras have relatively long half-life in the circulation, low immunogenicity and potential for non-invasive delivery by mucosal routes. In this project, the effectiveness of islet antigen-Fc chimeras for antigen-specific B-cell depletion in Type 1 diabetes will be evaluated using IA-2 as a model antigen.

In the present proposal we will explore the importance of a transcription factor, STAT6, in the regulation of Î²-cell health and viability and consider the hitherto overlooked possibility that loss of this protein may contribute to the demise of these cells in type 1 diabetes. This hypothesis is based on our novel finding that STAT6 is expressed exclusively within the Î²-cells of human islets and that its levels are reduced dramatically in these cells in patients with recent onset T1D. We also find that STAT6 is important for mediating the cytoprotective actions of various anti-inflammatory cytokines in Î²-cells and, collectively, our results imply that STAT6 plays a critical physiological role in maintaining Î²-cell viability. We will now establish the factors that regulate STAT6 expression in human Î²-cells and devlop a detailed understanding of the downstream effector mechanisms by which regulation of STAT6 activation promotes Î²-cell viability. Ultimately, we expect to reveal pathways which might be targeted selectively as a means to oppose the loss of Î²-cells occurring in human patients with diabetes.",University of Exeter Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy260,NOT FOUND

Background: SGLT2 inhibitors are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Their unique action promotes urinary glucose excretion with significant weight loss. Clinical trial programmes are under way for use in type 1 diabetes. However, there may be significant safety issues concerning the development of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. Hypothesis: In the presence of absolute or relative insulin deficiency, the rate of hepatic glucose production and peripheral lipolysis will increase. SGLT2 inhibition will increase urinary glucose excretion reducing the rise in glucose concentration, which would be expected to occur. The increased non-esterified fatty acid delivery to the liver as a result of unchecked lipolysis will result in increased ketogenesis. Methods: This will be a randomised metabolic study involving people with type 1 diabetes or relative insulin deficiency. Participants will receive in random order a SGLT2 inhibitor or placebo.

The latter is specialised for the use of de-novo synthesised fatty-acids and nascent diacylglycerol (DG) as substrates. Moreover, its activity lies upstream of that of DGAT1. This implies that TG formed by DGAT2 may give rise, upon lipolysis, to DG and acyl-CoA and, indirectly, to other insulin-resistance-inducing metabolites (e.g. ceramide) with a distinct composition. By contrast, TG synthesised by DGAT1 (which uses preformed, exogenous fatty acids and mono- and di-glycerides as substrates) may act as a sink for these metabolites. Therefore TG synthesised by DGAT2 may favour insulin resistance, whereas DGAT1 activity may favour insulin sensitivity, implying that not all intramyocellular TG is equivalent. Using three cohorts of individuals who are either at risk of developong diabetes, athletes, or controls, our work will test whether (i) DGAT2 activity is induced by hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in those at risk of developing T2DM (but not athletes), and correlates with insulin-resistance in vivo; (ii) whether the morphology and intracellular distribution of lipid droplets in different fibre-types is dependent on the DGAT1:DGAT2 expressioin ratio, and (iii) whether in cultured human myotubes, modulation of the DGAT1:DGAT2 activity ratio alters sensitivity to insulin action.",University of Warwick,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy270,NOT FOUND

We will utilise established mouse models of type 2 diabetes which replicate human diabetic nephropathy to identify lymphatic vessels and see if they associate with markers of renal disease.

Using sophisticated techniques, we will then delete the lymphatics to establish their function in diabetic mice.

Stimulation of these important physiological processes is critically dependent upon Protein Kinase B directed insulin signalling, whose inhibition by cell permeant DAG analogues is dramatically upregulated in muscle, heart and fat cells in which membrane abundance of caveolin/cavin-containing microdomains has been reduced. Cell and tissue expression of caveolins can also be down-regulated by increased fatty acid availability and obesity, which would predispose them to the insulin-desensitising effects of DAG.

Understanding how high glucose and its associated mediators alter cellular function is a critical step in reducing the burden of this debilitating complication. In diabetic nephropathy, elevated glucose and downstream pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-Î²1) induce fibrosis in the tubular interstitium. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is marked by accumulation of extracellular matrix and morphological/phenotypic changes, which predispose nephrotoxicity and irreversible renal failure. Normal proximal tubular epithelial cells form a highly coupled epithelial sheet, allowing for inter-cellular communication through connexin-mediated gap-junctions. In early nephropathy, loss of cell-adhesion represents the start of a series of events that culminate in disrupted cell-to-cell communication and dissociation of the epithelia. Utilising biopsy material from a cohort of patients with well-characterised diabetic nephropathy, in conjunction with complementary primary cell systems, this interdisciplinary proposal will define the mechanisms by which glucose-evoked changes in TGF-Î²1 regulate connexin-mediated cell communication in the diabetic kidney.

Professor,,David,Dunger,,,Diabetes UK,Diabetes UK,Paternal determinants of maternal glycaemic exposures in pregnancy,11/0004241,,GBP,121153,PROJECT,RESEARCH,01-06-2011,30-11-2012,"What is the aim of the research? To assess which key fetal imprinted genetic variants inherited from the father (i.e. genes where only the paternally-transmitted copy is active rather than copies inherited from both parents) are associated with raised maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy. Also to confirm whether these variants are associated with differences in placental gene expression (at birth). A preliminary estimate of the effects of paternal imprinted genes on maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) risk will be developed. What do we already know as a result of research carried out in this area, and how does the proposed research build on this? It is established that certain genetic variants in pregnant women are associated with increased glucose concentrations and future risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Thus far these variants have been related to the mother?s genes. However a few studies provide indirect evidence that variation in fetal genes inherited from the father can also be associated with maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy. Direct evidence for this phenomenon came from our recent studies where pregnant mice had raised circulating glucose concentrations in the last third of pregnancy when they were carrying pups where the fetal growth gene called Igf2 was over expressed. In humans we have now found that variation in the fetal copy of the equivalent IGF2 gene that is inherited from the father (the copy inherited from the mother being inactivated for this gene) is associated with increases in the motherâs glucose concentrations in the last third of pregnancy. The proposed research will build on this by: (1) seeking associations between variants in other candidate fetal imprinted genes (where the copy inherited from the father is the only one that is active), and maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy, (2) confirming that these associations are not population-specific, (3) confirming that these are associated with altered placental gene activities. Please outline the experimental/research methods to be used. This will primarily be a genetic association study, analysing genetic marker variants in newborn and parental imprinted genes in DNA from two Cambridge birth cohorts and in fetal and maternal DNA from an international collection. Relationships will be determined with maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy and with placental gene activity (Cambridge). An overall preliminary estimate of the influence of paternal imprinted genes on mother?s glucose concentrations in pregnancy will be derived. How will the research impact on people living with diabetes and what is the timeframe for this? The results from this study may help predict those women most at risk of developing gestational diabetes complementing data from other genome wide association studies of maternal GDM and T2DM risk. The utility of genetic prediction over and above family history is yet to be established but these studies will contribute to the debate and may provide insights into the pathophysiology of trans-generational risk for Type 2 diabetes potentially leading to new targeted intervention strategies in high risk groups within the next 2 years. Does the research involve animals? If yes, explain why alternatives cannot be used or the number of animals reduced? No. Does the research involve people? If yes, what does the research involve for the people taking part, are there any risks and what support will be offered to participants before, during and after the study? Where appropriate have people with diabetes been involved in the design of the study? 5 Title Paternal Determinants of Maternal Glycaemic Exposures in Pregnancy Purpose This project is designed to test the hypothesis that common polymorphic variations in fetal paternally-expressed imprinted genes are able to influence maternal glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Its specific objectives are: 1. To extend our previously observed associations linking four paternally-transmitted foetal insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP?s) and third trimester maternal glucose concentrations (identified in DNA trios collected through the Cambridge Baby Growth and Wellbeing cohorts) through study of 5,000 mother/offspring DNA dyads from the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study (HAPO). 2. To test for association between third trimester maternal glucose concentrations during pregnancy in the Cambridge and HAPO cohorts and paternally-transmitted foetal haplotype tag SNP?s from a further 9 candidate (imprinted and paternally-expressed) genes, that have previously been found to be involved in fetal and/or placental growth or changes in maternal/fetal glucose tolerance. 3. To confirm that those genes showing significant associations with maternal glucose concentrations also show variation in mRNA expression in placental tissue. Background Information Pregnancy is the one stage of life where variation in the genome of one individual is able to directly influence the metabolism of another. Polymorphic variations in maternal genes linked to higher circulating glucose concentrations, are associated with raised fetal glucose concentrations which stimulate fetal insulin secretion and enhance fetal growth (1). Currently established genetic risk factors for higher glucose concentrations in pregnancy include variants in at least 10 maternal genes (reviewed in (2)): KCNJ11, TCF7L2, CDKAL1, KCNQ1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, HHEX/IDE, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, TCF2, FTO (3-9). As well as being risk factors for the development of gestational diabetes (GDM), associations with higher glucose concentrations are important since results from the HAPO study of over 23,000 women suggest that even in the sub-diabetes range maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy are intimately linked to fetal growth and perinatal outcomes (10), including adiposity (11). Haig?s Kinship (Conflict) hypothesis (12, 13) suggests that genes that are paternally expressed (e.g. imprinted genes where only the paternally-transmitted copy is The research will involve using stored DNA samples and placentas (linked to maternal pregnancy glucose concentrations). There will therefore be no further risks or support required by the study participants. People with diabetes were involved in the development of the investigative protocols for HAPO and the Cambridge birth cohorts.","Currently established genetic variants associated with changes in maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy are related to maternal genetic risk for gestational diabetes (GDM) or Type 2 diabetes. However we have preliminary data suggesting that common polymorphic variation in the imprinted, paternally-expressed, fetal IGF2 gene, is also associated with maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy. In mice increased fetal Igf2 expression was associated with increased maternal glucose concentrations in pregnancy. We have confirmed these observations in human family DNA trios identifying association between paternally-expressed fetal IGF2 polymorphisms and maternal glycaemia in pregnancy. We hypothesise that common polymorphic variation in other paternally-expressed fetal imprinted genes involved in placental function or fetal growth may also influence maternal glycaemia. Using a two stage approach and DNA samples from two Cambridge birth cohorts (1,100 family trios) and the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes cohort (with European ancestry: 5,000 mother and offspring pairs), haplotype tag SNPs will be genotyped from 10 candidate imprinted genes (PLAGL1/PEG10/MEST/IGF2/FAM99A/DLK1/SNRPN/PEG3/NNAT/GNAS) and association sought between paternally-transmitted fetal SNPs and maternal glycaemia in pregnancy. Placental mRNA expression linked to associated genetic variants will be assessed to support these links. Overall we will establish the likely contribution of paternal imprinted genes to maternal GDM risk",University of Cambridge,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy302,NOT FOUND

Importantly, therapeutic interventions to alleviate glucolipotoxic-induced beta-cell defects are currently unavailable. Since glucolipotoxicity is a consequence of obesity and exercise is an effective strategy for obesity reduction and reducing blood glucose and lipids, we suggest physical activity as an important tool for managing glucolipotoxicity in T2D.

As HbA1c replaces glucose testing for diabetes diagnosis, and as chronic disease, including heart failure, cognitive decline, and cancer replace microvascular disease as major causes of morbidity and mortality, what is the optimal HbA1c threshold at which to diagnose diabetes and intervene? Why are women and ethnic minorities with diabetes particularly susceptible to the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes, and does this susceptibility extend to other chronic conditions? How does medication influence chronic disease risk in association with hyperglycaemia? We will address these questions using UK Biobank data on 500 thousand participants recruited from general practice, aged 40-69 years between 2006-10, with measurement of HbA1c and other risk factors, and extensive record linkage to capture events.

Children born to mothers with GDM have an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in adulthood, leading to a worsening intergenerational cycle of metabolic disease. Better understanding of the mechanisms through which GDM exposure translates into the development of obesity in children is urgently needed to break this cycle of metabolic disease. To date there have been few intervention studies in this area, which has led to a poor understanding of the mechanisms and thus ineffective targeting of the causal pathways. However, there is now growing evidence that maternal GDM induces stable modifications of the offspring epigenome, resulting in persistent changes in gene expression and a lifelong increased risk of obesity.

In particular, increased delivery of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, alongside that of glucose, to key metabolic tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle) imposes a major substrate burden on the cell's oxidative machinery as sustained oversupply of carbon fuel eventually exceeds respiratory drive and the cellular demand for energy. Under these circumstances, mitochondrial function, structure and dynamics are significantly compromised leading to heightened free radical production, increased proinflammatory signalling and accumulation of fatty acid-derived lipids that not only induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance but may further aggravate mitochondrial function. Interestingly, we find that palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and NFkB/COX-2 mediated proinflammatory signalling is antagonised by mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids and may also, beneficially, be antagonised by metformin and drugs activating AMPK that evoke an anti-inflammatory response. The work described herein aims to understand (i) how mitochondrial insufficiency induced by nutrient overload contributes to increased inflammatory signalling and insulin resistance in muscle cells, (ii) how inflammatory signalling may potentiate mitochondrial dysfunction and (iii) how impaired mitochondrial function and proinflammatory signalling induced by fuel oversupply can be mitigated to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.",University of Dundee,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy323,NOT FOUND

We propose that beta-cell GPR56 is involved in the maintenance of the beta-cell phenotype by islet ECM and this project will test the hypothesis that activation of GPR56 offers a therapeutic target for maintaining the functional beta-cell mass. We will characterise the role of GPR56 in improving islet function and mass and deliver GPR56 agonists with islet grafts to improve graft function after transplantation into diabetic mice. We will also identify the importance of GPR56 in maintaining the functional phenotype of beta-cells using mice in which beta-cell GPR56 is inducibly deleted.

Therefore, developing life-style/pharmaceutical interventions to chronically improve insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese people with prediabetes should have a high priority for future use in clinical management. In obesity, insulin resistance is associated with lipid (intramuscular triglyceride; IMTG) accumulation in skeletal muscle. Exercise stimulates the breakdown of IMTG in young, healthy, active individuals. However, obese individuals cannot breakdown IMTG during exercise, and as a result lipid metabolites accumulate in skeletal muscle that are known to induce insulin resistance. Previous research of the applicant in Maastricht has shown that in healthy trained men, acute ingestion of Acipimox (a specific inhibitor of adipose tissue lipolysis) before a bout of cycling exercise increases IMTG breakdown during exercise, and increases whole-body insulin sensitivity in the post-exercise period. The overall aim of the current proposal is to determine whether ingestion of Acipimox during each session of a 12-week exercise programme consisting of steady walking 3 times/week can improve whole body and muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose control in people at risk of developing T2D by reducing the accumulation of the mentioned lipid metabolites.",Liverpool John Moores University,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy344,NOT FOUND

The number one challenge to identifying putative molecular transducers lies in determining cross-talk between the contractile activity of skeletal muscles - characteristic of exercise - in relation to other organs exhibiting positive adaptations to exercise e.g. adipose depots, cardiovascular, brain, gut and liver tissues. This quandary founded the hypothesis that contracting muscles act in an endocrine fashion, secreting âexerkinesâ into the circulation that act on other organs to improve their function. Our basic scientific discovery would represent proof-of-concept directly in humans that the clinical detection of the synthesis and regulated secretion of exerkines is possible, in tandem to exploration of links to physiological and clinical responses to exercise training e.g. insulin sensitivity. This has never been attempted and would represent a major step forward in identifying clinically relevant factors regulating the health benefits of exercise. Proof-of-concept of this dynamic D2O-proteomics approach is absolutely necessary for future translation to larger clinical studies in patient populations, and could lead to the development of novel drug targets for promotion and maintenance of health in conditions such as type-2 diabetes.",University of Nottingham,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy355,NOT FOUND

Elevated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signalling drives these processes. Current treatments including anti-VEGF therapy are insufficient to restore defective vascular permeability or prevent disease progression to blindness, which occurs in many cases. It is therefore essential to investigate other therapeutic targets to limit or reverse diabetic complications caused by defective vascular permeability. While the biology of angiogenesis has been extensively investigated, much less is understood of the mechanisms by which vascular permeability is maintained in health and disrupted during disease. The Adrenomedullin1/Ramp2/Calcrl pathway is dysregulated in DR and stroke. We have generated zebrafish ramp2a and calcrlb mutants that display elevated VEGF signalling, vascular leakage, but normal vessel formation. This allows investigation of the interaction of Ramp2a/Calcrlb and VEGF on vascular permeability in isolation from angiogenesis. Pilot data indicates that Ramp2a/Calcrlb modulate VEGF, Angiopoietin1 (Angpt1) and Calcium signalling to limit vessel permeability and that vascular hyperpermeability following Ramp2a/Calcrlb mutation occurs via transendothelial mechanisms. We will establish the cause of vascular hyperpermeability resulting from ramp2a and calcrlb loss-of-function and determine the relative contribution of these to transcellular and paracellular mechanisms of VEGF-mediated vascular hyperpermeability.",University of Sheffield,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy356,NOT FOUND

Excessive glucocorticoid exposure has been shown to be deleterious for pancreatic beta cell function and insulin release. However, glucocorticoids at physiological levels are essential for many homeostatic processes, including glycaemic control. Our preliminary data show that, while glucocorticoids impair voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel function and Ca2+ fluxes, insulin secretion is maintained due to upregulation of amplifying cAMP signals, preserved beta cell metabolism and an increased number of insulin granules docked at the membrane. This steroid-regulated positive feedback loop is targeted by free fatty acids, leading to beta cell dysfunction and insulin insufficiency. Pertinently, failure of this protective mechanism may contribute to diabetes in states of glucocorticoid excess such as Cushingâs syndrome, which is associated with frank dyslipidaemia.

Ex-vivo expanded Tregs offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D), when infused in large numbers into diseased individuals. A major problem with this approach is the high number of Tregs required for a beneficial effect, which makes this therapy very laborious and expensive. Treg migration to inflamed tissue is key to their immune-modulatory function. We have recently discovered that the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) is instrumental for Treg migration in humans and mice, while it is not functional in conventional T-cells. Increasing GCK activity with the small molecule GCK-activator AZD1656 (a repurposed drug) enhances Treg migration to inflamed tissue thus reducing skin allograft rejection and the incidence of T1D in susceptible mice. This treatment does not affect Treg function. We predict that pharmacological GCK activation and enhanced Treg homing to pancreatic islets and draining lymph nodes will slow down and possibly stop beta cell destruction in early-onset T1D.

While the focus of prevention in T2D is on obesity, the âleanâ T2D variant (Ln-T2D) is not a rare condition. Ln-T2D patients exhibit similar degrees of cardiac concentric remodeling, myocardial steatosis and energetic impairment as obese T2D (Ob-T2D) patients at rest, and at stress they show more coronary microvascular dysfunction and greater reduction in myocardial energetics. Accumulating evidence suggests that these metabolic derangements in Ln-T2D are mediated by a defect in insulin secretory capacity through beta-cell dysfunction as opposed to insulin resistance which dominates in Ob-T2D. Despite the known pathophysiological differences to Ob-T2D, current prevention and treatment regiments do not address Ln-T2D differentially. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) have favorable effects on beta-cell morphology and volume and a demonstrated cardiovascular safety profile and offer the potential to improve cardiac outcomes specifically for the Ln-T2D variant. We hypothesize that treatment with GLP-1RA will promote beta-cell insulin secretion, restore coronary microvascular function, and modulate exercise metabolism in Ln-T2D patients compared peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist, which target peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Hypoglycaemia not only generates a series of very unpleasant symptoms, but can also increase the risk for several other health problems, including heart attacks. Moreover, mild to moderate hypoglyacemia itself can diminish a persons awareness to subsequent bouts of low blood sugar. This is known as impaired hypoglycaemia awareness (IHA) and leads to a substantial increase in risk for severe hypoglycaemia (SH). In extreme cases, SH can cause brain damage, coma and even death. One fundamental problem caused by diabetes, is the inability of the body to mount an appropriate defence against hypoglycaemia. The first line defence is normally glucagon release from the pancreatic alpha cell, but for poorly defined reasons, the glucagon response to low blood glucose becomes diminished in type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. Therefore, effective strategies to restore appropriate glucagon responses to hypoglycaemia has the potential to significantly improve glucose control.

Enzymes regulating m6A RNA methylation, including the methyltransferase METTL3, and/or miRNAs that have been reported to control m6A RNA methylation, may serve as potential therapeutic targets for endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.

Importantly, this process is reversible, meaning that strategies to reverse de-differentiation and maintain beta-cell identity could represent new therapeutic tools for treatment and prevention of T2D. Our supporting data suggests that maintenance of sufficient levels of beta-cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential for preventing de-differentiation.

As a result lipids and glucose cannot be stored appropriately leading to the development of severe Type 2 diabetes. Similarly, Type 2 diabetes occurs in obesity because overfilling of adipose tissues also causes a lack of lipid storage capacity. This project will determine whether the obesity medication lorcaserin could offer a new treatment for severe Type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic diseases in lipodystrophy. Lorcaserin is currently used therapeutically to reduce appetite, a key problem for lipodystrophy patients who lack the satiety hormone leptin. We have previously demonstrated that lorcaserin also improves Type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss. Lorcaserin has never previously been tested in lipodystrophy but as it has been shown to reduce appetite and improve glycaemia, independent of fat mass, in obese Type 2 diabetics, we believe lorcaserin offers an exciting opportunity to treat both diabetes and increased appetite in lipodystrophy. This would dramatically improve the lives of lipodystrophy patients and also provide important new insights regarding how lorcaserin could treat common Type 2 diabetes.",University of Aberdeen,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy395,NOT FOUND

In this context, emerging evidence indicates that obesity is associated with hyperactivation of a central component of the innate immune response known as the complement system, whose stimulation involves the production of complement peptide fragments such as C3a and C5a which activate specific G-protein coupled receptors, C3aR and C5aR, respectively. Intriguingly, we have recently discovered that C5aR is expressed in skeletal muscle, a key site for fuel storage and utilisation, and that its activation by C5a in muscle cells promotes marked insulin resistance, heightened inflammation and reduced capacity for mitochondrial fat oxidation. Crucially, these C5a-induced responses are prevented by co-provision of C5aR inhibitors. Allied to this, C5aR muscle expression is increased in mice fed a high calorie diet, as well as in human muscle cells derived from diabetic versus control non-diabetic individuals. We therefore hypothesise that inhibiting C5aR in skeletal muscle would ameliorate diet-induced insulin resistance by altering the expression/activity of key insulin signalling modulators, suppressing inflammation and/or improving mitochondrial function.

The study will provide evidence on whether CANA300 could be a potential treatment option for postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH) after bariatric surgery (BS). PHH is a common complication after BS which can be very disabling. The effectiveness of available treatments is limited and new approaches are needed. Pathophysiological studies suggest that patients with PHH after BS have higher peak postprandial glucose levels and insulin secretion compared to those without PHH. CANA300, a new treatment for type 2 diabetes, is inhibiting mainly Sodium-GLucose coTransporter-2 (SGLT-2), but also transiently intestinal SGLT-1. In healthy individuals, CANA300 reduces postprandial glucose excursions and peak postprandial insulin secretion, leading to higher nadir glucose levels, suggesting that it could be a potential treatment for PHH after BS. However, the effect of CANA300 after BS has not been evaluated yet and there is evidence that SGLT-1 function is reduced after RYGB due to altered bile flow. This randomised, open-label, two-period crossover study will investigate the effect of CANA300 on glucose, insulin, c-peptide, glucagon and incretins after RYGB and SG.

In this FELLOW, the applicant has identified a pathway involving Activated Protein C (APC) binding to Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) which could serve to protect retinal microvascular endothelial cells from diabetes-induced damage. APC has multiple vasoprotective properties by signalling through its receptor, EPCR. The hypothesis of this proposal is that modulation of the APC/EPCR signalling pathway can enhance the normal repair function of endothelial cells in the diabetic retina. Molecular mechanisms of the EPCR pathway and the potential of APC treatment to overcome diabetes-induced dysfunction will be dissected in cell culture models and in a mouse model of DR.

Unfortunately, this treatment is associated with many common gastrointestinal side effects. Nausea, the most common, occurs for 37% of the patients and the risk of side effects is increasing with higher doses. However, recent studies indicated that GLP-1 receptor is signalling in compartments inside the pancreatic beta-cells (not at the cell surface as it is the case for most of receptors). We hypothesize that side effects of exendin-4 can be considerably reduced by directly targeting this molecule inside the pancreatic beta-cells where the signalling occurs by encapsulating exendin-4 into lipid nanoparticles. This new drug delivery approach has been shown to improve efficacy, to avoid undesirable exposure and to require less circulating concentrations of drugs.

Although most published work in this area focuses on the hypothalamus, evidence exists for involvement of the brainstem dorsal vagal complex (DVC). The DVC is connected to the hypothalamus via direct neuronal projections. In turn, the DVC is bi-directionally connected, by the vagus nerve, to the pancreas, liver and gut. Astrocytes are an abundant glial cell type in the brain increasingly being recognised for their role in regulating physiology and behaviour. Utilizing Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs [DREADD]-technology to specifically control DVC astrocyte activity, our preliminary data support a role for these cells in integrating and responding to changes in energy availability: DREADD-mediated activation of DVC astrocytes potently inhibits food intake in mice even when their drive to feed is enhanced by fasting. We hypothesize that DVC astrocytes are also involved in mediating the physiological response to deviation from glucose homeostasis by modulating vagus nerve output. This will be tested using DREADD-technology to interrogate how DVC astrocytes and vagal premotor neurons are involved in physiological responses to deviations from euglycaemia in lean mice and an obese mouse model of type-2 diabetes.",University of Exeter Medical School,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy414,NOT FOUND

The metabolite Î²-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is secreted from muscle during exercise. BAIBA activates exercise-like muscle remodelling, improving muscle force, fatigue resistance and mitochondrial function. We will investigate whether BAIBA reduces diabetic muscle dysfunction. Human primary myocytes from healthy donors and people with T2DM will be treated with BAIBA. Mitochondrial respiration, protein anabolic and catabolic pathways, structural remodelling, and glucose and fatty acid metabolism will be assessed in the myocytes. In mice, T2DM will be induced using a high-fat diet. Mice will be treated with BAIBA. We will use muscle force-fatigue assays to determine whether BAIBA reverses diabetes-induced muscle dysfunction. High-resolution respirometry will determine whether BAIBA improves diabetes-related muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.

Background NDH and T2DM represent significant health and economic burdens. Glycaemic control is important to dental patients due to the established bi-directional co-morbid relationship between periodontitis and T2DM(2). Dental teams see patients regularly for âcheck-upsâ, whereas patients typically visit their GP when symptomatic(3, 4). Hence it is possible that dental teams could detect NDH or pre-symptomatic T2DM among a population not normally assessed by GPs. US-based research suggests that dental teams can be effective in identifying those with NDH or T2DM (5-8). NICE recommends healthcare professionals including dentists should assess individual risk of T2DM(9) using the Leicester Risk Assessment (LRA) tool, and to refer anybody with assessment scores above a threshold for confirmatory tests. The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) does not currently advocate population-based screening for T2DM, but guidelines are under review and the Committee has acknowledged that earlier identification of NDH/T2DM by targeted risk assessment (RA) could confer benefit. Thus, dental care offers an opportunity to detect NDH/T2DM, to improve patient outcomes and to bring health economic savings. The feasibility of such a model in the UK remains unknown, but given the high prevalence of periodontitis in T2DM, addition of dental risk-factors to the LRA may enhance positive/negative predictive values. PPI has revealed strong support of a role for dental teams in the identification of T2DM. Aims 1. To explore if routinely collected dental data could improve the accuracy of the LRA algorithm to predict risk of undiagnosed NDH/T2DM. 2. To determine key stakeholder opinions about RA and the possible contributions of NHS dental practices to the diabetes care pathway. Objectives 1. Evaluate if routinely collected records of periodontitis and tooth loss could contribute and improve the diagnostic accuracy of the LRA. 2. Understand opinions about the possible role of dental teams in the identification of NDH/T2DM. 3. Understand facilitators and barriers to dental RA and risk-targeted early detection of NDH/T2DM, to inform the design of these potential care pathways.",University of Birmingham,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy438,NOT FOUND

My provisional data suggests that in diabetes damage to the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx is mirrored by changes to the erythrocyte glycocalyx.

Senescent T-cells resemble those seen in patients with chronic hyperglycemia: poor control of infections, reduced vaccination responses together with elevated inflammatory activity. We have shown that people living with T2D have a higher circulating volume of senescent T-cells. However our findings suggest there are two populations of senescent T-cell in people living with T2D, a replicatively and inflammatory-derived population. This T2D-specific inflammatory population retain proliferative capacity, express inflammatory chemokine receptors and display a different metabolic prolife to their replicative-derived counterparts. We can however reverse aspects of senescence: reduce inflammation and restore insulin receptor recycling by knocking out TAB1Î². A mediator only found in senescent cells that phosphorylates p38 which controls senescence. The development of an immune-specific therapy is important as metformin has little effect on human T-cells. This project therefore aims to understand how inflammatory-derived senescent T-cells effect T2D and to test whether knockdown of TAB1Î² can restore function to these cells. This is an important goal as the presence of senescent T-cells has a detrimental impact on immune function during T2D.","Queen Mary, University of London",,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy441,NOT FOUND

Endothelial cells line the vasculature and form the barrier that selectively regulates these processes. Pericytes further support microvascular integrity and provide additional functional regulation. Diabetes causes vascular injury that can lead to important complications. Perhaps best studied is diabetic retinopathy, characterised by endothelial dysfunction and pericyte apoptosis that leads to vessel regression, followed by regrowth of poor quality leaky neovessels, causing blindness. It remains unclear whether diabetes and pre-diabetic conditions like obesity cause similar vascular abnormalities throughout the rest of the body. The intestine has a highly specialised microvascular network which has roles in nutrient absorption and immune cell regulation, and which acts as a barrier to microbial entry. Mice and humans with diabetes have a leaky gut wall, but the potential role of endothelial cells and pericytes in this disturbance is unknown. Historically, the intestinal vasculature has proved difficult to assess due to imitations of sample preparation and image resolution. This project will optimise a novel light sheet microscopy technique to allow three- dimensional imaging of the microvascular network of the intestine in health and disease, focussing on the identification and staining of endothelial cells and pericytes within these tissue preparations, along with imaging gut wall permeability.

It slowed beta-cell destruction when trialled in individuals with new onset type 1 diabetes (T1D), however benefits were deemed insufficient to support routine use of this therapy. One drawback of inhibiting CD28 costimulation is that this same pathway is also needed to support regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis. Thus, at the same time as inhibiting pathogenic T cells, the treatment also reduces Treg numbers. This undesirable side-effect impairs natural immunosuppression. We have found that this limitation can be offset by combining costimulation blockade with low dose IL-2 therapy. The resulting combination therapy supports Treg homeostasis while retaining inhibition of pathogenic T cell responses. Preliminary data suggest this combination therapy is highly effective at inhibiting diabetes in a mouse model. We now wish to follow up these exciting findings to understand key mechanistic questions about this therapy and its potential utility. Are the Treg that are rescued in this manner equivalent to normal Treg in their phenotype and suppressive properties? Is the therapy still effective if administered after diabetes has developed?

Increased cellular stress (hypoxia/ER/ inflammation) contributes to impaired adipocyte function, altered adipokine production, development of insulin resistance. Whilst the molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood, evidence supports a role for vitamin C. At the population level: obesity increases the requirement for vitamin C; low levels of vitamin C amplify type 2 diabetes risk; vitamin C supplementation improves glycemic control/insulin sensitivity. At the cellular level, in human adipocytes treated with TNFÎ± and palmitate (TNFÎ±+PA) to mimic the obese milieu, we reported that vitamin C: prevents hypoxia; reduces ER stress/inflammation; increases production of the active form of the beneficial adipokine, HMW adiponectin.

Inhibiting or reducing uncontrolled fatty acid release from adipocytes holds great promise for next-generation therapy of type-2 diabetes, but, surprisingly little is known about fatty acid transport in these cells. Discovery of new factors regulating fatty acid trafficking in adipocytes will open up novel therapeutic modalities that can prevent or reverse type-2 diabetes. Here, we propose to combine two target discovery strategies in mouse and human adipocytes. We will use organelle proximity specific proteome profiling during a lipolysis time course, and will employ cross-linkable fatty acids to capture lipid transport factors important for fatty acid release. To validate the function of the newly identified transport factors, we will employ CRISPR strategies for genetic perturbation followed by automated high content microscopy and metabolic experiments to measure cellular fatty acid release. Ultimately, our work aims at inhibiting adipocyte fatty acid release through small-molecules for next-generation therapy of type-2 diabetes.",University of Oxford,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy473,NOT FOUND

Previous work by our team and colleagues highlighted the importance of a new (truncated) tGADA test which detects antibodies that are more disease specific. Recently, using post-diagnosis samples, we showed that this test can help discriminate type 1 from type 2 diabetes in people who had tested positive for the original full length GADA assay.

The prevalence of hyperglycaemia promotes Î²-cell dysfunction, contributing to the development of complications that worsen the disease. We have recently shown that the transporter of lysosomal hydrolases mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) is directly repressed by microRNA-125b. MiR-125b is a negative regulator of Î²-cell lysosomal and secretory function which levels are increased by hyperglycaemia via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Downregulation of M6PR in mouse insulinoma cells leads to lysosomal defects and impaired insulin secretion, suggesting an important role in Î²-cell function. We propose to investigate the mechanism of action of M6PR in Î²-cells and its contribution to the effects of hyperglycaemia, AMPK and miR-125b in Î²-cell function. We will also explore whether preventing the binding of miR-125b to M6PR improves Î²-cell function and holds therapeutic potential.

Sleeve gastrectomy, which is nowadays more commonly performed, is not as well studied. Our study showed that women after sleeve gastrectomy had smaller fluctuations in glucose and better pregnancy outcomes: a later gestational age at delivery and higher birthweight. A later gestational age at delivery is linked to better childhood intellectual development and health. We propose a prospective study in pregnant women after metabolic surgery, to confirm that there are differences in outcome which favour sleeve gastrectomy, and to study the comparative performance of continuous glucose monitoring, blood glucose testing and oral glucose tolerance testing for diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Chronic hyperglycaemia is a major cause of diabetic foot disease and is associated with chronic inflammation and systemic oxidative stress. Chronic increases in oxidative stress are known to cause neutrophil hyperactivity with associated increases in the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), which further increases inflammation. We have previously showed that neutrophil hyperactivation in chronic diseases causes lipid and protein oxidation. Specifically, MPO-derived oxidised phospholipids were higher in circulation in patients with chronic kidney disease and these products cause endothelial cell dysfunction. Our recent work shows that patients with type 2 diabetes have higher blood MPO levels. Based on these findings, we hypothesise that MPO is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of DFU. Here we ask whether inhibition of MPO reduces generation of oxidised lipids in diabetes and therefore improves much needed vascularisation to promote wound healing.

We have shown that anti-INSR agonistic antibodies activate genetically damaged receptors and lower blood glucose in mice. This suggests a new way to circumvent the effect of INSR mutations. Beneficial effects of antibodies are blunted by INSR downregulation, however. The INSR is normally internalised following insulin binding and phosphorylation. Inside the cell insulin dissociates, permitting receptor recycling to the cell surface. We showed that antibody-activated receptors were also internalised but were not recycled, due to lack of antibody dissociation from the receptor. This is caused by tight molecular interactions between antibody and receptor that are not loosened when pH falls inside the endosomal sorting system.

Attempts to halt disease progression by therapeutic intervention are ongoing but are hampered by an incomplete understanding of disease aetiology at the level of the pancreas. I am addressing this knowledge gap by interrogation of a collection of human pancreas samples that provide detailed cell and molecular information about the processes that culminate in beta-cell loss. This has already provided important insights, including the description of two distinct disease endotypes which segregate according to immunotype and age at diagnosis. In the present work, I will build on this foundation by exploiting state-of-the-art digital pathology technologies to probe the pancreas in molecular detail. Defined molecular features of each endotype will be established at the level of individual beta-cells, and the importance of several novel phenomena observed in preliminary work will be explored. These include the abundance and role of a subset of beta-cells expressing unexpectedly high levels of unprocessed proinsulin which may be lost from islets in type 1 diabetes. Overall, this work will reveal new features of type 1 diabetes immuno-pathology and provide targets for improved therapeutic intervention.",University of Exeter,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy493,NOT FOUND

Despite significant improvements in care and management, reliance is still placed on insulin replacement as a primary mode of therapy rather than on strategies to arrest or reverse disease progression, or efforts to replace functional beta cells. Progress will only be possible with a more comprehensive understanding of disease processes in the target organ, the pancreas, which is difficult in situ. This current proposal builds on my experience and track record, and my access to rare pancreas biobanks, to explore new avenues which will lead directly to patient benefit. It will focus on: defining differences between individuals to better define distinct forms of T1D (WP1; Fig1); exploring strategies that beta cells use to resist immune attack (WP1/2); engaging with, and contributing to, global T1D research networks seeking to validate key immunotherapeutic targets (WP3). It will use state-of-the-art imaging platforms allowing detailed interrogation of pancreas tissue from global biobanks, coupled with in vitro model systems involving co-culture of beta cells and immune cells.

T1D is associated with many co-morbidities and increased risk of all-cause mortality. Insulin injections are a lifesaving treatment, yet are limited by the difficulty matching supply with demand, weight gain and hypoglycaemia. Islet and stem-cell transplantation are limited by the need to prevent immune rejection of the allograft, ectopic insulin release and questions over long term function. Moreover, it is unlikely that islet and stem cell transplants will become available for all those living with T1D. New disease-modifying approaches are urgently needed to restore endogenous beta cell function and stable glycaemic control in T1D. In this cross-disciplinary project we will identify, develop and validate new therapeutic strategies for promoting beta cell regeneration in the pancreas, to prime onward drug development programmes with clear line of site toward clinical trials.

Early intervention slows progression of diabetic CKD (DKD). The UK guidelines recommend multicomponent evidence-based intervention. Our recent analysis shows a stark unmet need and inequality in DKD management in primary care. Research shows point-of-care computer reminders are effective in delivering multiple clinical recommendations in primary care despite increasing workload, complexity of management and time pressure. Aim: To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a digital management tool to improve evidence-based care and outcomes for people with DKD in general practice (GP) Research questions: 1 Can a low cost, digital management tool be embedded in GP computer systems to improve clinician adherence to DKD guidelines recommendations? 2 Is the implementation of a digital management tool (intervention) clinically and cost-effective in slowing progression of DKD? Design: Type II hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomised trial Setting: General practices in England Population: GP staff and patients with T2D, aged 60-80 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 59-30 ml/min/1.73m2 Recruitment: General practices through Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Interventional Research Service Platform (IRSP) Intervention: Multicomponent intervention based on UK guideline recommendations 1.

Researchers in the USA and Denmark have developed and evaluated treatments for detecting, managing, and preventing diabetes distress. Although these are proving effective, they are not used in the UK. These international treatments will combine to form the âD-stressâ programme within the UK, NHS.

Study 2 tests if D-stress works as planned in practice and if our methods for data collection are acceptable.

Many new, different alterations in the INSR are still being discovered, but it is often difficult for diagnostic labs to determine which are disease causing, especially in minority ethnic groups. INSR changes are also found in the general population, but whether they are important for risk of conditions such as T2D is not well studied. The host labs recently developed an approach to studying the function of >15,000 alterations in the extracellular domain of the receptor simultaneously. In this project the same pipeline will be applied to the intracellular domain of the receptor, with additional studies of new aspects of receptor function relevant to disease.

Rolling beta cell replacement out as an option for the majority of people living with T1D remains the major goal. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1R) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIPR) receptors are 7-transmembrane receptors widely involved in beta cell function. Drugs targeting GLP1R and GIPR are the mainstay of type 2 diabetes and obesity therapy, since they influence insulin secretion and food intake. However, GLP1R and GIPR also constitute potentially powerful targets for T1D treatment, since: 1) GLP1R is a beta cell marker critical for proper function/survival; 2) GLP1R is expressed in a subpopulation (10-20%) of stem-cell derived beta cells (SBCs); 3) GLP1R is still present in beta cells in preclinical models of early T1D onset; 4) GLP1R provides a molecular address for precision delivery of drugs (e.g. gene therapy, immune inhibitors) directly to beta cells; and 5) GIPR (but not GLP1R) is highly expressed in alpha cells, which persist even during T1D, allowing interrogation of alpha cell to beta cell transdifferentiation.

Progressively the loss of the retinaâs oxygen supply results in hypoxia, driving uncontrolled growth of fragile new vessels. An emerging biological pathway that is disrupted before the appearance of DR is the circadian system, a system that integrates environmental signals for optimal adaptation around the daily light/dark cycle. We suggest that this disease-induced circadian disruption facilitates DR progression. In this project we will examine the role of the circadian clock in the retina vascular endothelial cells. Our hypothesis is that disruption of the vascular clock directly affects endothelial cell function. We will test this hypothesis with the following objectives: 1) To investigate whether deletion and overexpression of Bmal-1, a main transcription factor that regulates the circadian clock affects endothelial cell activation, survival and permeability, processes that represent retinal EC dysfunction in NPDR. 2) To investigate whether deletion and overexpression of Bmal-1 affects angiogenesis and tube formation, processes that represent retinal EC dysfunction in PDR.",Queen's University Belfast,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy514,NOT FOUND

However the impact of misclassification, and the optimal approach to using classification biomarkers, is unclear. In this research we will measure endogenous insulin secretion (C-peptide) in over 5600 UK Biobank participants with insulin-treated diabetes. We will use this information, alongside existing investigations and linked electronic healthcare records, to determine the prevalence of misclassification and identify when classification biomarker testing is likely to be helpful, both at diagnosis, and in longstanding diabetes. We will then determine the short and long term impact of initial subtype misclassification. The end result of this research will be the information needed to improve classification of diabetes subtypes by determining the appropriate targeting of biomarker testing.

The physiological and psychological effects can be challenging, with potentially negative impacts on health and quality-of-life. There is little evidence to guide diabetes management, psychological support and service provision but voices of women during âpatient and public involvementâ activities strongly support the need to investigate their needs. Purpose: To delineate the experience of the peri/menopause amongst women with Type 1 (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to inform service and educational development. Design: A mixed method exploratory sequential design comprising four Work Packages. Methods: A scoping review will map knowledge, identify evidence gaps and inform the next stages (WP1). Focus Groups (n=18) will explore the shared and the unique experiences of menopause from the perspectives of women with T1DM and T2DM across the United Kingdom (WP2). These will extend our understanding of menopause experience and inform instrument development. The survey instrument will be developed following recommended guidance (WP3). A comparative cross sectional, on-line, national survey of women with T1DM, T2DM or no diabetes will establish prevalence of symptoms, self-management experiences and help-seeking behaviours, overall and across the sub-groups with a validated instrument (WP4).",University of Ulster,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy528,NOT FOUND

We have found that individuals with T1D have lower plasma magnesium concentrations than in age/sex-matched controls and that these reduced levels associate with impaired fibrin clot lysis. Hypofibrinolysis predicts cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes and targeting this pathway has the potential to reduce thrombosis risk. We hypothesise that adequate plasma magnesium concentrations are important for normal haemostasis. We propose to examine the role(s) of magnesium in regulating fibrinolysis using in vitro/in vivo approaches and employing a clinical study of magnesium supplementation in deficient T1D individuals. We will analyse the effects of magnesium on thrombotic/fibrinolytic potential, glycaemic and insulin resistance measures as well as patient well-being. We also will determine whether magnesium deficiency (and subsequent supplementation) induces molecular changes in coagulation factors that may influence fibrinolysis. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how magnesium controls fibrinolysis and will determine the usefulness of monitoring plasma magnesium in T1D and correcting abnormally low levels.

They improve cardiorenal outcomes with benefits that go far beyond just glycaemic control. However, common mechanisms that underpin these multi-system effects are largely unknown. Whilst efficacy for SGLT2i Empagliflozin in blocking (NOD)-like receptor protein- 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in T2DM patients at high cardiovascular risk was recently reported, we have identified a role for aberrant Cx43 hemichannel-mediated ATP-release in renal NLRP3 inflammasome activity, activation of which is linked to cell senescence and its pro-inflammatory secretome across multiple tissue types. Moreover, our preliminary data suggests that SGLT2i in addition to its effects on NLRP3, block Cx43 hemichannel activity in glucose treated donor macrophages and primary kidney tubule cells. Elucidating a role for SGLT2i in regulating these events would facilitate understanding for how these compounds can be used effectively to treat this multifactorial condition. Utilising multiple cell types found in and around the kidney, treated to recapitulate the late-stage inflammation of diabetic nephropathy, this study will test the hypothesis that SGLT2iâs protect through suppression of NLRP3, Cx43-hemichannel activity and the senescence induced pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, each a perpetrator of sterile inflammation in T2DM and its complications.",University of Lincoln,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy533,NOT FOUND

In this FELLOW I will identify and characterise new genetic forms of autoimmune diabetes, uncovering new mechanisms of beta-cell destruction. I will overcome barriers to studying the immune system of individuals with monogenic autoimmune diabetes using a novel DNA-based approach. These individuals have defined mechanistic subtypes of beta-cell autoimmunity, and the resulting immunoregulatory signatures will provide a way to map autoimmune subtypes in type 1 diabetes.

This equates to approximately 1 million people in the UK. A characteristic complication of GC treatment is steroid diabetes, particularly for individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes. Up to 40% of individuals taking GC treatment develop steroid diabetes. Current treatments, however, are limited to insulin and gliclazide, but these are not without side effects - including the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Evidence for other treatments is lacking. GCs are thought to drive the metabolic side effects through inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master metabolic regulatory enzyme. Drugs that activate AMPK can therefore prevent metabolic complications of GC treatment. The widely used diabetes treatment, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues activate AMPK, leading to favourable effects on metabolism. GLP-1 may therefore be an effective treatment for steroid diabetes. This project will determine if a GLP-1 analogue can prevent steroid diabetes in people with pre-diabetes and prevent steroid-induced hyperglycaemia in people living with lifestyle-controlled diabetes. By understanding how hyperglycaemia may be prevented using GLP-1 analogues, clinicians could immediately prescribe such medications, reducing the burden and impact of this very common side effect.",Imperial College London,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy535,NOT FOUND

This highlights the need for new therapeutic avenues. Clinical studies revealed that leucine-rich-Î±2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG1) is elevated in the vitreous humor of diabetic patients. We have evidence that mice lacking LRG1 are protected from diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction and that pericytes exposed to recombinant LRG1 transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells. While we know that pericyte dysfunction precedes, and likely promotes, the vision-threatening stage of DR, our poor understanding of this phenomenon and its molecular drivers restricts the design of effective earlier treatments for patients. I propose to use a preclinical model of early DR and human retinal tissues to dissect the role of LRG1 in early pericyte dysfunction and to test the efficacy of LRG1-blockade in preventing retinopathy in diabetic mice.

My previous research showed that the transcription factor Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2âRelated Factor 2 (NRF2) regulates the expression of a unique composition of ECM by fibroblasts and accelerates healthy wound healing in mice. However, the potential of NRF2-regulated ECM to advance wound healing in diabetes remains to be investigated. For this research, I will use a mouse model of diabetic wound healing, and an ex vivo wound model using human skin from diabetic patients, to evaluate the effectiveness of ECM-containing hydrogels derived from NRF2-activated fibroblasts in promoting healing. I will also conduct in vitro investigations to elucidate the mechanisms by which NRF2-regulated ECM signalling influences fibroblast behaviour specifically in the context of diabetes. This investigation therefore aims to uncover novel insights into diabetic wound healing mechanisms, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and enhancing our understanding of ECM-driven processes.

Current treatments are designed to prevent further damage to retinal blood vessels but do not address the earlier stages of DR. Patients with DR also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimerâs disease (AD) where there could be shared pathophysiological processes between brain and retina. During AD, accumulation of toxic amyloid beta occurs due to dysfunction of the brainâs waste clearance system (the glymphatic system). Although much less well described, the retina also possesses a glymphatic system which is dependent on integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and especially on the homeostatic role of the MÃ¼ller glia. All cells of the retinal NVU are known to become dysfunctional during DR although we have little knowledge about the role of the glymphatic system during diabetes. Understanding this will provide an important therapeutic opportunity and also go some way to explaining the established linkage between visual and cognitive decline, especially in type 2 diabetes.

Dr,,Sophie,Jones,,,Diabetes UK,Diabetes UK,Comparing the physiological effects of low-calorie diets in South Asian and White European individuals with early-onset Type 2 Diabetes,24/0006855,,GBP,399879.98,,FELLOW,03-03-2025,02-03-2028,,"140,000 people in England, and >260 million people worldwide are diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) before the age of 40-years. Compared to diagnosis in later-life, early-onset T2D has a more severe course, with faster progression to needing insulin, higher rates of diabetes-complications and a life-expectancy that is shortened by approximately 14 years. Worryingly this age bracket also shows the fastest rise in incidence of T2D. In 2016, the DiRECT study showed that after following a 12-week low-calorie diet, 46% people with T2D were in remission a year later, meaning that sugar levels were back to normal without needing medications. This important finding has led to the Path-to-Remission programme, which is available nationally on the NHS to individuals aged 18-65-years who are offered a similar low-calorie diet. However, 99% of those studied in DiRECT were White European, and only 7 out of 298 people in the trial were aged <40-years (2.3%). Whether similar results are observed in younger age groups and other ethnicities is a knowledge gap concluded by the study authors, a key research priority of Diabetes UK, and a research priority identified by the international consensus group on the clinical translation of precision diabetes medicine. Why study younger age groups and ethnic minorities? A third of individuals with early-onset T2D in England are of Asian ethnicity, and preliminary unpublished data from the Path-to-Remission programme show that the chance of remission is lower in those <40-years compared to older age groups, and lower in Asians of all ages compared to White Europeans. The likelihood of achieving remission following a low-calorie diet is closely linked to the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. Studies have shown lower insulin production from the pancreas in those diagnosed with T2D at a younger age, and in South Asian individuals compared to White European individuals. It is not clear if this is due to the nature of their diabetes, genetics, or compliance with the diet. Aims and objectives The objectives of this study are: 1. To compare the physiological effect of a low-calorie diet in South Asian and White European individuals with early-onset T2D 2. To investigate whether ethnic differences in physiological response may result from the features of their diabetes, genetics, or dietary compliance. I will study White European and South Asian individuals with early-onset T2D before and after participating in the NHS Path-to-Remission programme, studying: â¢ Clinical features â¢ Insulin secretion from the pancreas â¢ Liver and pancreas fat content â¢ Genetic risk for low pancreatic insulin secretion â¢ Compliance with the low-calorie diet. This work will expand the evidence base for low-calorie diets in achieving remission of T2D in those with early-onset T2D and unpick underlying ethnic differences in South Asian T2D populations, who are currently under-represented in research. Understanding age-based and ethnicity-based differences in the response to diabetes-interventions is critical in progressing towards a precision-medicine approach to diabetes remission. An exploration of how individual physiology, genetics and programme adherence contribute to the observed differences in remission rates following low-calorie diets will facilitate future research to address these differences and will further our understanding of the parameters that predict diabetes remission, promoting both more informed patient choice and the allocation of low-calorie diets to produce maximum benefit.",Imperial College London,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy549,NOT FOUND

One in 20 pregnant women in the UK are diagnosed with GDM. GDM usually goes away after the pregnancy ends, but around half of the women with GDM develop another form of diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) within five years of their pregnancy. The chance of developing T2DM is increased if women have an unhealthy diet, donât get enough exercise or control their blood sugar levels as advised by a healthcare professional. South Asian women, meaning women from Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and SriLankan ethnicities, are at a much higher risk of developing GDM and developing T2DM afterwards, compared to other ethnic groups in the UK. To fix this, we need to understand the experience of South Asian women with GDM and provide care that meets their needs. However, people from different South Asian backgrounds should not be treated as one group. There are differences in culture, religion, education, language, lifestyle, and views about health which can impact their experience in dealing with GDM and their risk of developing T2DM afterwards. Previous research has grouped all South Asian ethnic groups together, so we do not understand the different experiences of each group. In particular, British-Pakistani women (BPW) have higher rates of GDM compared to other South Asian groups and are also more likely to develop T2DM compared to White British women. BPW are also a large population in the UK who experience poorer health than many other ethnic groups. It is therefore important to understand why many BPW are developing T2DM after GDM and how their healthcare can be improved to prevent this. Aim To explore the health experiences of BPW with GDM during and after their pregnancy, including how they engage with recommended healthcare services to understand why they may be at a higher risk of developing T2DM, and how this could be reduced. Methods I will carry out three studies: 1. I will survey BPW with GDM to find out what they know about GDM, how it should be managed and possible outcomes. I will find out what they know about, and if they plan to attend two services the NHS offers to women with GDM after birth. This includes blood sugar testing and the Diabetes Prevention Programme, which provides support on following a healthy lifestyle to prevent T2DM. 2. I will identify how many BPW with GDM get referred to, start and complete the Diabetes Prevention Programme after pregnancy compared to other ethnic groups. 3. I will interview BPW who have experienced GDM to understand which factors impact their GDM experience, healthcare and how they follow recommendations. I will interview health care professionals such as GPs and midwives to understand their views on this too. 4. I will hold workshops with BPW and healthcare professionals where we will review the results of the research and work together to create recommendations for how GDM healthcare can be improved for BPW. PPI BPW with lived experience of GDM will be involved throughout each study, making sure it addresses their needs and concerns. This will include reviewing study materials, checking they are sensitive and relatable to BPW, guiding how we interpret the findings and sharing findings with the community. Dissemination My findings will be shared with the general public, BPW and healthcare professionals across the UK using published articles, video summaries, posters and talks. I will share the GDM healthcare recommendations for BPW with local governments and policymakers involved in maternal healthcare to promote positive change in GDM care for BPW.",University of Warwick,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy550,NOT FOUND

Our proposal aims to assess whether these inhibitors could be repurposed as a T1D treatment. We will address this by fully characterising the impact of the clinically used broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors, SAHA and Romidepsin, on IFN signalling in EndoC-Î²H1 cells and human islets; examining STAT1 phosphorylation, localisation, transcriptional activity and downstream gene/protein expression (e.g. HLA-I). To identify the HDAC isoforms responsible we will individually knockdown HDACs and examine which reciprocates the effect of the inhibitors. Expression of HDAC isoforms identified to regulate STAT1 signalling will be explored in pancreas from people with and without T1D. Finally, we will examine whether HDAC inhibitors can work additively with other putative T1D treatments which target the same pathway (JAK inhibitors).

Interestingly, cilia dysfunction has been linked to an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). It is well established that cytotoxic T-cells attack Î²-cells, leading to their destruction and onset of T1D. Cilia may play a role in this process, as they are involved in sensing environmental cues and have been shown to interact with immune cells. As a preliminary step, I have performed an in-silico analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets of mouse and human islets in naÃ¯ve and T1D state, and aligned the data with known cilia gene dataset.

Therapeutics targeting immune cells are successful but associated with adverse effects. Immune cell trafficking to transplanted islets is driven by multiple chemokines, and anti-chemokine therapeutics targeting single chemokines fail. Tick evasin proteins bind multiple chemokines and potently inhibit inflammation. Using phage-display screening followed by mutagenesis we have identified short evasin-derived peptides that inhibit multiple chemokine classes. They are highly effective against a pool of islet-expressed chemokines. We hypothesize that neutralizing islet-expressed chemokines will ameliorate transplanted islet inflammation and beta-cell destruction. The aims of this project are to develop approaches to inhibit transplanted islet inflammation.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has revealed distinct Î²-cell subpopulations with unique transcriptional profiles, that have been linked to their secretory and regenerative capacities. ScRNA-seq has also detected transcriptional changes within specific Î²-cell subpopulations in prediabetes and T1D, suggesting distinct susceptibilities to disease progression. In vitro generated stem-cell derived islets (SC-islets) also contain transcriptionally distinct Î²-cell subpopulations, but these subpopulations arenât identical to primary islets. This may contribute to their reduced functionality, which is one of the important limitations for the clinical use of SC-islets in replacement therapies. Most scRNA-Seq protocols cannot detect microRNAs (miRNAs). Thus, whether miRNA expression is heterogeneous within islet Î²-cells or whether miRNA action contributes to their molecular and functional heterogeneity remains unexplored. MiRNAs are negative regulators of gene expression essential for the development, survival and function of pancreatic Î²-cells. Given recent findings showing heterogeneous presence and action of miRNAs within other cell types, we hypothesize that miRNAs contribute to the molecular and functional heterogeneity of pancreatic Î²-cells. Accordingly, we propose a collaborative approach using cutting-edge molecular and imaging techniques to explore and compare miRNA expression and targeting at high-throughput and single-cell levels between SC-islets, human islets and pancreatic tissue in health and T1D. This project will provide novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying heterogeneous susceptibility of Î²-cells to T1D development and progression and why SC-derived islets arenât as functional as primary islets. This knowledge could enhance current efforts in preserving and generating Î²-cells for treating T1D.",Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge: Innovation PROJECT,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy562,NOT FOUND
Dr,,Craig,Beall,,,Diabetes UK,Diabetes UK,Brain cells for beta cells,24/0006738,,GBP,399956.46,,RESEARCH,01-11-2024,31-10-2026,,"The proposed research aims to investigate the potential of choroid plexus epithelial cells (ChPECs) as a novel cell therapy for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). ChPECs, known for their secretion of cerebrospinal fluid containing trophic factors, growth hormones, and angiogenic factors, have shown promise in reducing the impact of various neurological diseases. Importantly, ChPEC transplants have been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in people with Parkinson's disease, highlighting their translational feasibility. The study seeks to explore the impact of ChPECs on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Î²-cell function and survival, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the effectiveness of stem cell Ã-cell therapies in T1D. Furthermore, the project aims to create a fully human in vitro transplantation model to examine pseudoislet vascularisation. The innovative nature of the research lies in its potential to repurpose brain stem cell therapies for diabetes, enhance the benefits provided by MSCs in islet/stem cell Ã-cell transplantation, and create a fully human in vitro islet/pseudoislet vascularisation model, which could be useful to many in the field. If successful, the outcomes of this study could lay substantial groundwork for further translational grant schemes and potential clinical development. The proposed research represents a significant step forward in the exploration of ChPECs as a potential cell therapy for T1D. By leveraging recent developments in choroid plexus stem cell models, organoid research and organ-on-a-chip manufacture, the study aims to develop high-quality, human-relevant models to rapidly examine ChPEC feasibility as a component of future T1D stem cell therapies.",Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge: Innovation PROJECT,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy563,NOT FOUND
Dr,,Ahmad,Al-Mrabeh,,,Diabetes UK,Diabetes UK,Developing an optimal in vitro cellular model to study the mechanism(s) of pancreas lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes,24/0006736,,GBP,15000,,RESEARCH,07-10-2024,06-06-2025,,"In addition to losing normal insulin secretory function, the pancreas in type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoes progressive loss of its mass. Remission of T2D after weight loss decreases pancreatic fat content, returns normal insulin secretion, and increases total pancreas volume. However, this dietary approach is challenging, thus understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to remission at cellular level is critical to develop more durable therapies. Given than acinar cells constitute most of the pancreas tissue, and the islets represent only ~5%, we hypothesize that lipotoxicity induces similar damage to acinar and Î²-cells which is reversible at early stages. This project aims to optimise conditions for isolating and culturing primary pancreatic cells (islet/acinar cells) from human donors. Secondly, it will develop a vitro cellular model for reconditioning islet cells and assess whether removing the metabolic stimulus (lipotoxic stress) restores normal Î²-cell function. Ultimately, this project will help to establish the optimal conditions for recovering pancreatic cell function and study their behaviour in response to toxic lipids. This will elucidate the mechanism(s) by which excess fat exerts it lipotoxic effects and could lead the way to novel strategies to manage diabetes and maintain normal pancreas health and function.",Early-Career Small Grant,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy564,NOT FOUND
Dr,,Karla,Suchacki,,,Diabetes UK,Diabetes UK,Regulation of glucose metabolism by the skeleton: From individual pathways to systems biology,24/0006735,,GBP,14871,,RESEARCH,30-09-2024,29-09-2025,,"Skeletal research has focused on the pathogenicity of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) on the skeleton. DM is associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fracture, whereas obesity increases bone mineral density (BMD) but impairs bone quality. However, cellular, molecular and mouse models have recently revealed that the skeleton is not merely an endocrine target but also a secretory organ, modulating systemic energy homeostasis. My previous research has identified that (1) the skeleton is a significant site of glucose uptake (using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computerised tomography; PET/CT) (2) different bones have a unique glucose metabolism and form complex metabolic networks, identified using our newly developed PET fingerprinting technique. My research aims to determine if compromised skeletal structure contributes to whole body metabolism. A rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis and healthy control will undergo dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT to determine 18F-FDG uptake into the bone, cartilage, white and brown adipose tissue (WAT; BAT), heart, muscle, and liver. Whole-body PET fingerprinting technology will be used to identify skeletal / metabolic networks and determine if these networks are altered by bone dysregulation. Such knowledge might lead to the identification of novel pathways through which bone disease causes insulin resistance and metabolic disease.",Early-Career Small Grant,,12-03-2025,PI,COORDINATOR,GBR,GBR,© The British Diabetic Association operating as Diabetes UK,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/legal-information/privacy-policy565,NOT FOUND
